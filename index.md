## This is the test front page for the CSMI metadata repository

Here you will find metadata for datasets that are available from CSMI funded work for US-led projects. The intention of this repository is to provide an overview of the types of data available, who to conatct about projects quesitons, and how to gaina access to the data. Optional additional information is available for some datasets that provides a higher level of detail. 

This repository is a collaboration between EPA, UMD, USGS, WI-DNR, and Sea Grant.
